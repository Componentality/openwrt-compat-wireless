# The purpose of this script is to enable developers use compat-drivers
# backport work without having to carry code on their tree. This lets
# developers synch to newer compat-drivers releases to gain more backport
# work. If you use this throw the files into your .gitignore:
#
# compat/
# udev/
# include/
# scripts/
# .compat_base_tree
# .compat_base_tree_version
# .compat_version
# config.mk
#
# An example git tree for standalone development will be provided later.
# Once run you can then just run on your standalone development tree:
#
# ./refresh-compat
#
# This is a copy of refresh-compat-local that we maintain here
# You can keep that in your git tree as otherwise its hard for users to
# know what to run.
