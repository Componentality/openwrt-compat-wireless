# Linux compat drivers compatibility package

This package provides backport support for drivers from newer kernels
down to older kernels. It currently backports 3 subsystems:

  * Ethernet
  * Wireless
  * Bluetooth

This package provides the latest Linux kernel subsystem enhancements
for kernels 2.6.24 and above. It is technically possible to support
kernels < 2.6.24 but more work is required for that.

# Documentation

This package is documented online and has more-up-to date information
online than on this README file. You should read the wiki page
and not rely on this README!
